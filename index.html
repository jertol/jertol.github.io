    <p>I am a data scientist with 7 years of experience working across the United States, Israel, and France. My research interests lie in the fields of interpretable machine learning and tabular data learning. I have deep expertise in predictive maintenance, working with real estate data, and modeling consumer behavior.</p>
    <p>In recent years, I co-founded Future Frame, a venture-backed startup developing transformer models to make predictions on tabular data. I led a team of data scientists at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hippo.com/">Hippo</a>, working on risk scoring, lead scoring, and the acquisition of third-party data sources. I started my career as a research scientist at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.interpretable.ai/">Interpretable AI</a>, where I developed intrinsically interpretable machine learning algorithms and worked with clients in industries ranging from manufacturing to real estate and insurance.</p>
    <p>I got my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://orc.mit.edu/academics/master-business-analytics/">MBAn</a> from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, where I studied data science, did research in natural language processing with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/">McKinsey & Company</a>, and organized a series of talks on artificial intelligence by senior executives. Prior to MIT, I studied applied mathematics at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en">École Centrale Paris</a> and physics at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://louislegrand.fr/">Lycée Louis-le-Grand</a>.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about history, and I was able to trace my genealogy back to 1492, when my ancestors left Toledo, Spain. I enjoy reading French literature (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Cohen_(novelist)">Albert Cohen</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Tuil">Karine Tuil</a>), as well as American (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Roth">Philip Roth</a>) and Israeli (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Oz">Amos Oz</a>) novels.</p>
